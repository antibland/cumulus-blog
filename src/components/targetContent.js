            Meet the Owner, Laura Gershman

          <p>
            Having an entrepreneurial spirit myself, there is nothing I could
            imagine more satisfying than helping other small business owners
            succeed. Bookkeeping is a vital, yet commonly overlooked and
            misunderstood component that every single business must have to
            thrive. This may sound odd, but I get a lot of satisfaction from
            reconciling a bank account, and making sure every penny is accounted
            for! When Iâ€™m not arming small businesses with all of the info they
            need to make wise financial decisions, I enjoy coffee, biking,
            pinball, and playing oboe. I live in Portland, Oregon with my
            husband and two cats, Abe and Farfel.
