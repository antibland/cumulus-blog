            You wear many hats as a small business owner. You focus your time
            and energy on getting and keeping customers and providing the best
            service for your clients. Generally, you are pretty organized and
            proactive when it comes to your business. Maybe you have been trying
            to keep up with your books but you have a nagging feeling you are
            missing something or not doing it right. Or maybe you are delegating
            the bookkeeping to a family member or employee and trusting they are
            doing it right. Or...maybe you have given up or never even started

          Just because you outsource your bookkeeping does not mean you will be
          kept in the dark about your finances. A good bookkeeper keeps an open
          line of communication and has regular check-ins with you.
