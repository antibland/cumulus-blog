          You wear many hats as a small business owner. You focus your time and
          energy on getting and keeping customers and providing the best service
          for your clients. Generally, you are pretty organized and proactive
          when it comes to your business. Maybe you have been trying to keep up
          with your books but you have a nagging feeling you are missing
          something or not doing it right. Or maybe you are delegating the
          bookkeeping to a family member or employee and trusting they are doing
          it right. Or...maybe you have given up or never even started
          bookkeeping{" "}

          Just because you outsource your bookkeeping does not mean you will be
          kept in the dark about your finances. A good bookkeeper keeps an open
          line of communication and has regular check-ins with you.
